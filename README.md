# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict credit card approval using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features and historical data, the model will provide a prediction on whether a credit card application will be accepted or rejected.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card applications, including attributes such as income, age, employment status, and credit history. It is important to note that the dataset used is for demonstration purposes only and does not contain real customer data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/davidsequera/don_armando.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:

    ```shell
    python preprocess.py
    ```

2. Train the model:

    ```shell
    python train.py
    ```

3. Make predictions:

    ```shell
    python predict.py
    ```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to predict credit card Approval. Further analysis and evaluation of the model's performance can be found in the [results](results.md) file.
